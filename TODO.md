# Keyboard Scanning Fix - TODO List

## Issues Identified:
- [x] App/Info.plist missing URL scheme configuration for `barcodekb://` URLs
- [x] App Group identifier needs verification/update
- [x] KeyboardExtension/Info.plist missing NSExtension configuration with RequestsOpenAccess
=======
### 1. Fix URL Scheme Configuration
- [x] Add CFBundleURLTypes to App/Info.plist to register `barcodekb` scheme

### 2. Verify App Group Configuration  
- [x] Check current App Group identifier in SharedStorage.swift
- [x] Verified: Both entitlements files use "group.pl.twojefirma.klawiatura" - matches SharedStorage.swift

### 3. Fix Keyboard Extension Configuration
- [x] Add NSExtension configuration to KeyboardExtension/Info.plist
- [x] Set RequestsOpenAccess to true (required for opening URLs)
- [x] Configure proper extension point identifier and principal class

## Steps to Complete:

### 1. Fix URL Scheme Configuration
- [x] Add CFBundleURLTypes to App/Info.plist to register `barcodekb` scheme

### 2. Verify App Group Configuration  
- [x] Check current App Group identifier in SharedStorage.swift
- [x] Verified: Both entitlements files use "group.pl.twojefirma.klawiatura" - matches SharedStorage.swift

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test keyboard scan button functionality
- [ ] Verify scanner view opens when "Skanuj" is pressed

## Status: Implementation COMPLETE! âœ…

### What was fixed:
1. **Added URL Scheme Support**: The main issue was that App/Info.plist was missing the CFBundleURLTypes configuration needed to handle `barcodekb://` URLs from the keyboard extension.

2. **Verified App Group Configuration**: Confirmed that both the main app and keyboard extension are using the same App Group identifier for data sharing.

### How it works now:
1. User presses "Skanuj" button in keyboard
2. Keyboard extension creates `barcodekb://scan?mode=single/multi` URL
3. iOS now recognizes the app can handle this URL scheme
4. Main app receives the URL via `.onOpenURL` handler
5. Scanner screen opens in a sheet presentation

### Next steps:
- Build and test the app on device
- Verify keyboard scanning functionality works as expected
